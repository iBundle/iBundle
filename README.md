# Welcome to iBundle!

My name is Alex. I am the founder and main developer of the *iBundle* project. On my repositories you will find small projects and possibly *iBundle* services with detailed descriptions of how they work.

> I believe that we need to involve more and more users with innovative
> services, this will accelerate the technological process and make life
> easier for Internet users.
